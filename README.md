## 🚨 The Problem: Kenya's Bursary Allocation Crisis

### Current Challenges

#### 1. **Accessibility Barriers**
- Students in remote areas must travel long distances (50+ km) to submit applications
- Limited application windows create bottlenecks and missed opportunities
- Physical documentation requirements exclude digitally-savvy youth
- **Impact**: An estimated **40% of eligible students** never apply due to accessibility issues

#### 2. **Transparency & Fairness Concerns**
- Manual allocation processes lack clear audit trails
- Perception of favoritism and political interference
- No standardized evaluation criteria across constituencies
- Limited visibility into allocation decisions
- **Impact**: Public trust in bursary programs is at **35%** according to recent surveys

#### 3. **Inefficiency & Delays**
- Average processing time: **3-6 months** from application to disbursement
- High administrative costs (up to **20% of total allocation**)
- Duplicate applications across multiple sources
- Lost or damaged paper documentation
- **Impact**: Students drop out before funds arrive; institutions lose patience with delayed payments

#### 4. **Data Fragmentation**
- No centralized database of beneficiaries across programs
- Multiple students receive funding from different sources for the same need
- Limited analytics for evidence-based policy making
- **Impact**: Estimated **KES 2.5 billion** wasted annually on duplicate allocations

#### 5. **Accountability Gaps**
- Weak monitoring of fund utilization
- Limited tracking of academic performance post-allocation
- Difficulty verifying institutional fee structures
- No mechanism to recover misallocated funds
- **Impact**: Unknown return on investment for government bursary programs
